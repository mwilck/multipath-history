.SH NAME
multipath.conf \- multipath daemon configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B "multipath.conf"
is the configuration file for the multipath daemon. It is used to
overwrite the built-in configuration table of \fBmultipathd\fP.
Any line whose first non-white-space character is a '#' is considered
a comment line. Empty lines are ignored.
.SH SYNTAX
The configuration file contains entries of the form:
.RS

.LP
Each \fIsection\fP contains one or more attributes or subsections. The
recognized keywords for attributes or subsections depend on the
section in which they occor.
.LP
The following \fIsection\fP keywords are recognized:
.TP 17
.B defaults
This section defines default values for attributes which are used
whenever no values are given in the appropriate device or multipath
sections.
.TP
.B blacklist
This section defines which devices should be excluded from the
multipath topology discovery.
.TP
.B blacklist_exceptions
This section defines which devices should be included in the
multipath topology discovery, despite being listed in the
.I blacklist
section.
.TP
.B multipaths
This section defines the multipath topologies. They are indexed by a
\fIWorld Wide Identifier\fR(wwid), which is the result of the
\fIgetuid_callout\fR program.
.TP
.B devices
This section defines the device-specific settings.
.RE
.LP
.SH "defaults section"
The
.B defaults
section recognizes the following keywords:
.TP 17
.B polling_interval
interval between two path checks in seconds. For properly functioning paths,
the interval between checks will gradually increase to
.B max_polling_interval;
default is
.I 5
.TP
.B max_polling_interval
maximal interval between two path checks in seconds; default is
.I 4 * polling_interval
.TP
.B udev_dir
directory where udev creates its device nodes; default is
.I /dev
.TP
.B verbosity
default verbosity. Higher values increase the verbosity level. Valid
levels are between 0 and 6; default is
.I 2
.TP
.B reassign_maps
enable reassigning of device-mapper maps. With this option multipathd
will remap existing device-mapper maps to always point to multipath
device, not the underlying block devices. Possible values are
\fIyes\fR and \fIno\fR. Default is
.I yes
.TP
.B path_selector
The default path selector algorithm to use; they are offered by the
kernel multipath target. There are three selector algorithms.
.RS
.TP 12
.B "round-robin 0"
Loop through every path in the path group, sending the same amount of IO to
each.
.TP
.B "queue-length 0"
Send the next bunch of IO down the path with the least amount of outstanding IO.
.TP
.B "service-time 0"
Choose the path for the next bunch of IO based on the amount of outstanding IO
to the path and its relative throughput.

.I devname 
regex can be of device name format  Ex: sda , sd.e
Generate the path priority based on the regular expression and the 
priority provided as argument.
.TP
Default value is \fBnone\fR.
.RE
.TP
.B features

Query the EMC Clariion specific EVPD page 0xC0 to determine the path
state.
.TP
.B hp_sw

.TP
.B directio
Read the first sector with direct I/O.
.TP
Default value is \fIdirectio\fR.
.RE
.TP
.B failback
Tell the daemon to manage path group failback, or not to. 0 or
.I immediate
means immediate failback, values >0 means deferred failback (in
seconds).
.I manual
means no failback. Default value is
.I manual
.TP
.B  rr_min_io
The number of IO to route to a path before switching to the next in
the same path group. Default is
.I 1000
.TP
.B rr_weight
If set to \fIpriorities\fR the multipath configurator will assign
path weights as "path prio * rr_min_io". Possible values are
.I priorities
or
.IR uniform .
Default is
.IR uniform .
.TP
.B no_path_retry
Specify the number of retries until disable queueing, or
.I fail
for immediate failure (no queueing),
.I queue
for never stop queueing. Default is 0.
.TP
.B user_friendly_names
If set to 
.I yes
, using the bindings file
.I /etc/multipath/bindings
to assign a persistent and unique alias to the multipath, in the form of mpath<n>.
If set to 
.I no
use the WWID as the alias. In either case this be will
be overriden by any specific aliases in the \fImultipaths\fR section.
Default is
.I no
.TP
.B max_fds
Specify the maximum number of file descriptors that can be opened by multipath
and multipathd.  This is equivalent to ulimit -n. A value of \fImax\fR will set
this to the system limit from /proc/sys/fs/nr_open. If this is not set, the
maximum number of open fds is taken from the calling process. It is usually
1024. To be safe, this should be set to the maximum number of paths plus 32,
if that number is greated than 1024.
.TP
.B checker_timeout
Specify the timeout to user for path checkers that issue scsi commands with an
explict timeout, in seconds; default taken from
.I /sys/block/sd<x>/device/timeout
.TP
.B fast_io_fail_tmo
Specify the number of seconds the scsi layer will wait after a problem has been
detected on a FC remote port before failing IO to devices on that remote port.
This should be smaller than dev_loss_tmo. Setting this to
.I off
will disable the timeout.
.TP
.B dev_loss_tmo
Specify the number of seconds the scsi layer will wait after a problem has
been detected on a FC remote port before removing it from the system.
.TP
.B queue_without_daemon
If set to
.I no
, when multipathd stops, queueing will be turned off for all devices.
This is useful for devices that set no_path_retry.  If a machine is
shut down while all paths to a device are down, it is possible to hang waiting
for IO to return from the device after multipathd has been stopped. Without
multipathd running, access to the paths cannot be restored, and the kernel
cannot be told to stop queueing IO. Setting queue_without_daemon to
.I no
, avoids this problem. Default is
.I yes
.B bindings_file
The full pathname of the binding file to be used when the user_friendly_names option is set. Defaults to
.I /var/lib/multipath/bindings
.

.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
The usage of
.B queue_if_no_path
option can lead to
.B D state
processes being hung and not killable in situations where all the paths to the LUN go offline.
It is advisable to use the
.B no_path_retry
option instead.
.P
The use of
.B queue_if_no_path
or
.B no_path_retry
might lead to a deadlock if the
.B dev_loss_tmo
setting results in a device being removed while I/O is still queued.
The multipath daemon will update the
.B dev_loss_tmo
setting accordingly to avoid this deadlock. Hence if both values are
specified the order of precedence is
.I no_path_retry, queue_if_no_path, dev_loss_tmo
