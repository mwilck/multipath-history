2003-12-29 multipath-012
	* check hotplug event refers to a block device; if not exit early
	* refresh doc
	* add the uninstall target in Makefile
2003-12-22 multipath-010
	* tweak the install target in Makefile
	* stop passing fds as argument : this change enable a strict
	  segregation of ugly 2.4 code
	* sysfs version of get_lun_strings()
	* be careful about the return of get_unique_id() since errors 
	  formerly caught up by if(open()) in the caller fn are now returned
	  by get_unique_id()
	* send get_serial() in unused.c
	* introduce dm-simplecmd for RESUME & SUSPEND requests
	* split add_map() in setup_map() & dm-addmap()
	* setup_map() correctly submits "SUSPEND-RELOAD-RESUME or CREATE"
	  sequences instead of the bogus "RELOAD or CREATE"
	* don't print .sg_dev if equal to .dev (2.6) in print_path()
	* since the kernel code handles defective paths, remove all
	  code to cope with them :
		* move do_tur() to unused.c
		* remove .state from path struct
		* remove .state settings & conditionals
	* add a cmdline switch to force maps to failover mode,
	  ie 1 path per priority group
	* add default policies to the whitelist array (spread io ==
	  MULTIBUS / io forced to 1 path == FAILOVER)
	* move get_disk_size() call out of add_map() to coalesce()
	* comment tricky coalesce() fn
	* bogus unsused.c file renamed to unused.c
2003-12-20 multipath-010
	* big ChangeLog update
	* start to give a little control over target params :
	  introduce cmdline arg -i to control polling interval
	* cope with hotplug-style calling convention :
	  ie "multipath scsi $DEVPATH" ... to avoid messing with
	  online maps not concerned by an event
	* example hotplug agent to drop in /etc/hotplug.d/scsi
	* revert the run & resched patch : unless someone proves me
	  wrong, this was overdesigned
	* move commented out functions in unused.c
	* update multipath target params to "udm[23] style"
	* mp target now supports nr_path == 1, so do we
	* add gratuitous free()
	* push version forward
2003-12-15 multipath-009
	* Make the HW-specific get_unique_id switch pretty
	* Prepare to field-test by whitelisting all known fibre array,
	  try to fetch WWID from the standard EVPD 0x83 off 8 for everyone
	* configure the multipath target with round-robin path selector and
	  conservative default for a start (udm1 style) :
	  yes it makes this release the firstreally useful one.
	* temporarily disable map creation for single path device
	  due to current restrictive defaults in the kernel target.
	  Sistina should work it out.
	* correct the strncmp logic in blacklist function.
	* update the Makefiles to autodetect libgcc.a & gcc includes
	  "ulibc-style". Factorisation of udevdirs & others niceties
	* drop a hint about absent /dev/sd? on failed open()
	* implement a reschedule flag in /var/run.
	  Last thing the prog do before exit is check if a call to multipath
	  was done (but canceled by /var/run/multipath.run check) during its
	  execution. If so restart themain loop.
	* implement a blacklist of sysfs bdev to not bother with for now
	  (hd,md, dm, sr, scd, ram, raw).
	  This avoid sending SG_IO to unappropiate devices.
	* Adds a /var/run/multipath.run handling to avoid simultaneous runs.
	* Remove a commented-out "printf"
	* drop a libdevmapper copy in extras/multipath;
	  maybe discussions w/Sistina folks will bring a better solution in the future.
	* drop a putchar usage in libdevmapper to compile cleanly with klibc
	* drop another such usage of my own in main.c
	* massage the Makefile to compile libdevmapper against klibc
	* use "ld" to produce the binary rather than "gcc -static"
	* stop being stupid w/ uneeded major, minor & dev in main.c:dm_mk_node()
	* reverse to creating striped target for now because the multipath target
	  is more hairy than expected initialy
	* push the version code to 009 to be in synch w/ udev
2003-11-27 multipath-007
	* removes sg_err.[ch] deps
	* makes sure the core code play nice with klibc
	* port the sysfs calls to dlist helpers
	* links against udev's sysfs (need libsysfs.a & dlist.a)
	* finally define DM_TARGET as "multipath" as Joe posted the code today (not tested yet)
	* push version forward (do you want it in sync with udev version?)
2003-11-19
	* merged in udev-006 tree
2003-09-18  Christophe Varoqui <christophe.varoqui@free.fr>
	* multipath 0.0.1 released.
	* Initial release.
