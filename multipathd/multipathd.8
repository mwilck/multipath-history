.TH MULTIPATHD 8 "November 2009" "Linux Administrator's Manual"
.SH NAME
multipathd \- multipath daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B multipathd
.RB [\| options \|]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B multipathd 
daemon is in charge of checking for failed paths. When this happens,
it will reconfigure the multipath map the path belongs to, so that this map 
regains its maximum performance and redundancy.

This daemon executes the external multipath config tool when events occur. 
In turn, the multipath tool signals the multipathd daemon when it is done with 
devmap reconfiguration, so that it can refresh its failed path list.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-d
Forground Mode. Don't daemonize, and print all messages to stdout and stderr.
.TP 
.B -v "level"
Verbosity level. Print additional information while running multipathd. A  level of 0 means only print errors. A level of 3 or greater prints debugging information as well. 
.TP
.B -k 
multipathd will enter interactive mode. From this mode, the available commands can be viewed by entering "help". When you are finished entering commands, press CTRL-D to quit.

.SH COMMANDS
.TP
The following commands can be used in interactive mode:
.TP
.B list|show paths
Show the paths that multipathd is monitoring, and their state. 
.TP
.B list|show maps|multipaths
Show the multipath devices that the multipathd is monitoring. 
.TP
.B list|show maps|multipaths status
Show the status of all multipath devices that the multipathd is monitoring.
.TP
.B list|show maps|multipaths stats
Show some statistics of all multipath devices that the multipathd is monitoring.
.TP
.B list|show maps|multipaths topology
Show the current multipath topology. Same as "multipath -ll".
.TP
.B list|show topology
Show the current multipath topology. Same as "multipath -ll".
.TP
.B list|show map|multipath $map topology
Show topology of a single multipath device specified by $map, e.g. 36005076303ffc56200000000000010aa.
This map could be obtained from "list maps".
.TP
.B list|show config
Show the currently used configuration, derived from default values and values specified within the configuration file /etc/multipath.conf.
.TP
.B list|show blacklist
Show the currently used blacklist rules, derived from default values and values specified within the configuration file /etc/multipath.conf.
.TP
.B list|show devices
Show all available block devices by name including the information if they are blacklisted or not.
.TP
.B list|show status
Show the number of path checkers in each possible state, the number of monitored paths, and whether multipathd is currently handling a uevent.
.TP
.B add path $path
Add a path to the list of monitored paths. $path is as listed in /sys/block (e.g. sda).
.TP 
.B remove|del path $path
Stop monitoring a path. $path is as listed in /sys/block (e.g. sda).
.TP
.B add map $map
Add a multipath device to the list of monitored devices. $map can either be a device-mapper device as listed in /sys/block (e.g. dm-0) or it can be the alias for the multipath device (e.g. mpath1) or the uid of the multipath device (e.g. 36005076303ffc56200000000000010aa). 
.TP
.B remove|del map $map
Stop monitoring a multipath device.
.TP
.B resize map|multipath $map
Resizes map $map to the given size
.TP 
.B switch|switchgroup map $map group $group
Force a multipath device to switch to a specific path group. $group is the path group index, starting with 1.
.TP
.B reconfigure
Reconfigures the multipaths. This should be triggered automatically after any hotplug event.
.TP
.B suspend map|multipath $map
Sets map $map into suspend state.
.TP
.B resume map|multipath $map
Resumes map $map from suspend state.
.TP
.B fail path $path
Sets path $path into failed state.
.TP
.B reinstate path $path
Resumes path $path from failed state.
.TP
.B disablequeueing map|multipath $map
Disabled queuing on multipathed map $map
.TP
.B restorequeueing map|multipath $map
Restore queuing on multipahted map $map
