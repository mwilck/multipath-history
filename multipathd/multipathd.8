.TH MULTIPATHD 8 "November 2009" "Linux Administrator's Manual"
.SH NAME
multipathd \- multipath daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B multipathd
.RB [\| options \|]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B multipathd 
daemon is in charge of checking for failed paths. When this happens,
it will reconfigure the multipath map the path belongs to, so that this map 
regains its maximum performance and redundancy.

This daemon executes the external multipath config tool when events occur. 
In turn, the multipath tool signals the multipathd daemon when it is done with 
devmap reconfiguration, so that it can refresh its failed path list.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-d
Foreground Mode. Don't daemonize, and print all messages to stdout and stderr.
.TP
.B \-s
Suppress timestamps. Do not prefix logging messages with a timestamp.
.TP
.B -v "level"
Verbosity level. Print additional information while running multipathd. A  level of 0 means only print errors. A level of 3 or greater prints debugging information as well. 
.TP
.B -B
Read-only bindings file. Multipathd will not write to the user_friendly_names
bindings file. If a user_friendly_name doesn't already exist for a device, it
will use its WWID as its alias.
.TP
.B -k 
multipathd will enter interactive mode. From this mode, the available commands can be viewed by entering "help". When you are finished entering commands, press CTRL-D to quit.

.SH COMMANDS
.TP
The following commands can be used in interactive mode:
.TP
.B list|show paths
Show the paths that multipathd is monitoring, and their state. 
.TP
.B list|show paths format $format
Show the paths that multipathd is monitoring, using a format string with path
format wildcards.

Show topology of a single multipath device specified by $map, e.g. 36005076303ffc56200000000000010aa.
This map could be obtained from "list maps".
.TP
.B list|show wildcards

.TP
.B list|show config
Show the currently used configuration, derived from default values and values specified within the configuration file /etc/multipath.conf.
.TP
.B list|show blacklist
Show the currently used blacklist rules, derived from default values and values specified within the configuration file /etc/multipath.conf.
.TP
.B list|show devices
Show all available block devices by name including the information if they are blacklisted or not.
.TP
.B list|show status
Show the number of path checkers in each possible state, the number of monitored paths, and whether multipathd is currently handling a uevent.
.TP
.B list|show daemon
Show the current state of the multipathd daemon
.TP
.B add path $path
Add a path to the list of monitored paths. $path is as listed in /sys/block (e.g. sda).
.TP 
.B remove|del path $path
Stop monitoring a path. $path is as listed in /sys/block (e.g. sda).
.TP
.B add map|multipath $map
Add a multipath device to the list of monitored devices. $map can either be a device-mapper device as listed in /sys/block (e.g. dm-0) or it can be the alias for the multipath device (e.g. mpath1) or the uid of the multipath device (e.g. 36005076303ffc56200000000000010aa). 
.TP
.B remove|del map|multipath $map
Stop monitoring a multipath device.
.TP
.B resize map|multipath $map
Resizes map $map to the given size
.TP 
.B switch|switchgroup map|multipath $map group $group
Force a multipath device to switch to a specific path group. $group is the path group index, starting with 1.
.TP
.B reconfigure
Reconfigures the multipaths. This should be triggered automatically after any hotplug event.
.TP
.B suspend map|multipath $map
Sets map $map into suspend state.
.TP
.B resume map|multipath $map
Resumes map $map from suspend state.
.TP
.B reset map|multipath $map
Reassign existing device-mapper table(s) use use the multipath device, instead
of its path devices.
.TP
.B reload map|multipath $map
Reload a multipath device.
.TP
.B fail path $path
Sets path $path into failed state.
.TP
.B reinstate path $path
Resumes path $path from failed state.
.TP
.B disablequeueing maps|multipaths
Disable queueing on all multipath devices.
.TP
.B restorequeueing maps|multipaths
Restore queueing on all multipath devices.
.TP
.B disablequeueing map|multipath $map
Disable queuing on multipathed map $map
.TP
.B restorequeueing map|multipath $map
Restore queuing on multipahted map $map
.TP
.B forcequeueing daemon
Forces multipathd into queue_without_daemon mode, so that no_path_retry queueing
will not be disabled when the daemon stops
.TP
.B restorequeueing daemon
Restores configured queue_without_daemon mode
.TP
.B map|multipath $map setprstatus
Enable persistent reservation management on $map
.TP
.B map|multipath $map unsetprstatus
Disable persistent reservation management on $map
.TP
.B map|multipath $map getprstatus
Get the current persistent reservation management status of $map
.TP
.B quit|exit
End interactive session.
.TP
.B shutdown
Stop multipathd.

.SH "SYSTEMD INTEGRATION"
When compiled with systemd support two systemd service files are
installed,
.I multipathd.service
and
.I multipathd.socket
The
.I multipathd.socket
service instructs systemd to intercept the CLI command socket, so
that any call to the CLI interface will start-up the daemon if
required.
The
.I multipathd.service
file carries the definitions for controlling the multipath daemon.
The daemon itself uses the
.B sd_notify(3)
interface to communicate with systemd. The following unit keywords are
recognized:
.TP
.I WatchdogSec=
Enables the internal watchdog from systemd. multipath will send a
notification via
.B sd_notify(3)
to systemd to reset the watchdog. If specified the
.I polling_interval
and
.I max_polling_interval
settings will be overridden by the watchdog settings.

Please note that systemd prior to version 207 has issues which prevent
the systemd-provided watchdog from working correctly. So the watchdog
is not enabled per default, but has to be enabled manually by updating
the multipathd.service file.
.TP
.I OOMScoreAdjust=
Overrides the internal OOM adjust mechanism
.TP
.I LimitNOFILE=
Overrides the
.I max_fds
configuration setting.
