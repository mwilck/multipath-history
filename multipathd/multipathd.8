multipathd \- multipath daemon
.SH SYNOPSYS
.B multipathd

This daemon is in charge of checking for failed paths. When this happens,
it will reconfigure the multipath map the path belongs to, so that this map 
regains its maximum performance and redundancy.

This daemon executes the external multipath config tool when events occur. 
In turn, the multipath tool signals the multipathd daemon when it is done with 
devmap reconfiguration, so that it can refresh its failed path list.
